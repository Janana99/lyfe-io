# lyfe-io
An enviromental web-app forecasting air &amp; water quality and wildfires

## This web app focuses on everyday environmental issues around the globe and spreading awareness about it. It shows all the needed data in all the right places for users to integrate as much as possible

## Inspiration
Recently a lot of wildfires have been happening around Europe and North America, yet all the web apps and other programs are made for administrators and professionals in that field. Therefore we got an idea - To spread awareness about environmental issues and make a user friendly app so anybody can see the information transparently.
We got this idea on the night of hackathon, as we were watching the news and heard that parts of Greece were still burning and that air was getting worse and worse. A couple of weeks ago, Belgium was flooded... So we decided to take action.
## What it does

This web app focuses on everyday environmental issues around the globe and spreading awareness about it. It shows all the needed data in all the right places for users to integrate as much as possible

## How we built it
We developed the app using Bootstrap, JQuery and CSS, along with Firebase for our small "Backend"

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We wanted to monetize the app as well, so we added a donation module along with social media platforms and a partner programme.

Fetching different APIs overnight, we found a great solution for the frontend as well, where the UX would try to reach maximum capacity on every functionality.

## What's next for lyfe.io- environmental web app
The point of this app is to develop it further and implement real monetization. And its an app that can last a long time in such a dynamic world we live in.
